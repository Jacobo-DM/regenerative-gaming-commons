# Regenerative Gaming Commons

Regenerative Gaming is a commons-based approach to game design focused on restoration rather than extraction.

These games are designed to:
- Restore attention instead of fragmenting it
- Engage the whole body, not just the eyes and thumbs
- Cultivate care, attunement, and reciprocity
- Leave players, places, and relationships more whole than before

This is not gamification.
This is not engagement engineering.
This is play as a regenerative act.

## What Lives Here

- Games that train listening, presence, and embodied intelligence
- Designs suitable for children, adults, animals, classrooms, and healing spaces
- Systems that measure quality of attention rather than success or failure

## Lineage

This commons emerged from the Flower Road ecosystem, Discovery Mode, and long-form experiments in somatic learning, storytelling, and ecological listening.

It is offered openly, with care.

## Stewardship Note

You are free to use, remix, and adapt these works.
If you build upon them, please preserve their regenerative intent.
Do not turn them into tools of extraction, surveillance, or coercion.

Games shape behavior.
Design accordingly.
