# Principles of Regenerative Game Design

1. Attention is the primary resource.
   Do not exploit it.

2. The body is part of the interface.
   Design for breath, posture, tone, and movement.

3. Calm restores systems.
   Panic and haste should meaningfully disturb the game world.

4. Success is not the goal.
   Quality of listening is.

5. Regeneration must be real.
   The world should heal in response to care.

6. No dark patterns.
   No addiction loops.
   No hidden extraction.

7. Games teach ethics whether we intend them to or not.
   Design as if that matters.
   
8. Regenerative games should have an analog equivalent, where possible.
   If a game cannot be enacted—at least in part—through bodies, breath,
   attention, and shared space, it risks drifting toward abstraction and extraction.

9. A regenerative game is one where even the smallest beings can participate
   without being harmed.
